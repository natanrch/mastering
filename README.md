# mastering
My personal time counter for my work.

I believe that you may be considered a master at your field when you reach 10 thousands hours of work. I decided to create this counter to use everytime I'm creating something. I divided it in 4 fields: coding, UX, SEO and Engineering. Those are capacities we wait of a web developer. By dividing the work (web developer) in subcategories, I can be sure about how much time I spent in any of these fields. In the future I will add more fields like IA and more programming languages.

Maybe it's not true that you become a master when you reach 10 thousands hours of work. But this a good goal and it's very satisfying to be sure about how many time you spent at something.
